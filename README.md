The local code is purely for demo purposes and reference

To play:
Run the Server THEN the Client

IF you would like to play on two separate computers that are connected to the same wifi do as follows:

IN SERVER CODE:
comment line 6 and uncomment line 7. Run the server code to find out what the IP address for the server is.

IN CLIENT CODE:
Then take that IP found in the server code and enter it into line 7. Uncomment line 7 and comment line 6
